	<h1>Who's your neighbor ?</h1>
	<p>Terron ( earth) being a planet where any alien spieces can just visit, many have made Terron their new home.Terron holds about 80 different spieces with Zoltrians being the highest and humans being the lowest spieces on the planet. Aliens can roam free through the planet and see it many beautiful loctaions, even seeing the ruins of what earth used to be like before the war. Many major cities that used to be on earth were completely destroyed but few remain. Humans must remain in the units theyr are assigned to and can only leave the unit with permisson. Humans are not allowed to leave the planet as they still remained a flagged spieces but the Zoltrions.</p>
