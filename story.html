<h1>When did this begin ?</h1>
<br>
<p>According to the remaining history before the war, it says that the war was started by the human race around the year 2020. The leaders of the coutries at this time had made full contact with alien life. The Aliens that made contact wanted to help the human popluation in trying to stop their planet from dying. This didn't go well since the aliens quickly realized how violent and selfish the human race was. The Galatic Empire called Zoltrion began to take action towards trying to stop the planet from dying but human kind saw this as a threat and started to attack. War began between Earth and zoltrion lasting around 100 years after thewar ended and the Zoltrion's won earth was remained Terron but with a 100 year war only only about 25 % of earths poplution reamninding, there wasnt much earth left. It was stated that other alien races could come live on this planet and try to help it regrow into a healthier planet again. The remainding humans were left in small units but are seen as less than and second class citzens. </p>
